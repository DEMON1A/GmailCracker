THIS DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE DUE TO GOOGLE TIGHTENING SECURITY.

The command line utility requires the WWW::Curl module to be installed. It takes 2 arguments. The first is the Gmail user name. 

The second argument is the password list file. The passwd file must end with .list only because I wanted people to be conscious 

of what files they were passing. 


The UI requires a few more deps. For all of you uncomfortable with installing modules from the command line or from source via 

cpan.org's tarball pkg's, there is a makefile to automate the installation of the deps. The Build.sh file removes all manual intervention.

Run it once and thats it.


NOTE: I have written this on my Gentoo box and am uncertain of anything pertaining to MS Windows.

THIS MODULE WILL NOT TAKE PASSWORD WITH SPACES ATM.
